# BTTAI Microsoft Project - News Categorization

## Project Overview

This project involves the exploration, preparation, analysis, and machine learning modeling of the **BBC News** dataset for categorizing news articles into the following categories:

- **Business**
- **Entertainment**
- **Politics**
- **Sport**
- **Tech**

The main objective is to build and evaluate different machine learning models that can predict the category of a given news article based on its content. The project aims to demonstrate the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify text data efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **BBC News Dataset**, which contains a collection of news articles. Each article is labeled with a category, and the task is to predict the category based on the text of the article.

You can access and download the dataset from Kaggle:
